}
\details{
This function collects all queued Inkscape actions stored in
\code{.fundsr$ink_queue}, constructs a single Inkscape command using the
executable specified by the \code{fundsr.inkscape} option, and executes it
via \code{system()}. On success, the queue is cleared. On failure, the queue
is preserved and a message is printed.
