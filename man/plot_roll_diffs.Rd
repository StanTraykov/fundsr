\usage{
plot_roll_diffs(
  data,
  n_days,
  funds,
  use_log = FALSE,
  gg_params = NULL,
  title_add = NULL,
  date_brk = NULL,
  qprob = c(0.005, 0.995),

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data frame containing a \code{date} column and one rolling-difference
column per fund (specified by \code{funds}).}

\item{n_days}{Window length (in days) used to compute rolling differences (used
for labelling).}

\item{funds}{Character vector of fund column names to include.}

\item{use_log}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, labels the plot as log-return differences.
If \code{FALSE}, labels the plot as CAGR differences.}

\item{gg_params}{Optional ggplot components to add to the plot.}

\item{title_add}{Optional title suffix. Can be a single string or a named
character vector specifying the title in multiple languages (e.g. \code{c(en=..., bg=...)}).}

\item{date_brk}{Optional date-break specification for the x-axis (e.g. \code{"3 months"}).
If \code{NULL}, it is chosen automatically based on the time span and available data.}

\item{qprob}{Two-element numeric vector giving lower and upper quantiles used
to set the baseline y-axis limits. Defaults to \code{c(0.005, 0.995)}.}

\item{bmark_type}{Benchmark type used in the title: \code{"net"} or \code{"gross"}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Plots rolling annualized tracking differences (CAGR-style or log-return) for
selected funds against their benchmark series. The plot uses quantile-based
y-limits and formats the y-axis in basis points.
}
\details{
The function reshapes \code{data} to long format and produces a scatter plot coloured
by fund. The y-axis limits are primarily determined from quantiles of the rolling
differences (as specified by \code{qprob}), always including 0.

To avoid clipping recent extremes, the y-limits are expanded (if needed) to also
include the full range observed in the most recent 30 days of data, even when
those values fall outside the \code{qprob} quantiles.

The x-axis breaks are chosen as follows when \code{date_brk} is \code{NULL}: for spans of
up to 3 years, breaks default to \code{"3 months"}. For longer spans, breaks are
anchored to calendar months (semiannual or quarterly depending on span) and
are included only when the data range extends beyond the midpoint to the
neighboring break.
